# WordPress Solo

This will setup WordPress on a single EC2 instance.

This is a work in progress and will be largely based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html

This is not meant for production use. For a production Wordpress setup, please see the /examples/wordpress
